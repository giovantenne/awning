# A dockerized Bitcoin + LND + BTCPay  node

Something like [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com) but lighter and portable.
Something like [RaspiBolt](https://raspibolt.org/) but easier and automated. Bitcoin/Lightning-Network oriented with no frills.

**Awning** doesn't install anything on your PC, making it lightweight, customizable and portable.
It is a plain/vanilla Docker setup.

## Disclaimer

# Prerequisites
- git
- curl
- docker
- docker-compose (or [`docker compose plugin`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/))

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose-v2 git curl
```


# Run your BTC / LN / BTCPay node (the easy way):

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the awning.sh utility script

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/giovantenne/awning.git
$ cd awning
$ ./awning.sh
```
You can run the `./awning.sh` utility script every time you want to interact with your node.

https://github.com/giovantenne/awning/assets/917400/43319ca7-4552-4608-b3ce-2b2ddd9778dd


# ... or manually setup your node instead:
If you want to have full control you can manually setup your node in 6 steps.

Please follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) if you don't want to preface the `docker` and the `docker-compose` commands with `sudo`.
In this guide  `sudo` will be always omitted.
All the commands need to be run on the **Awning** root directory.

Here is the steps:

1. [Clone this repository](#1)
2. [Create a Github repository for storing the LND Static Channel Backups (SCB)](#2)
3. [Edit and customize the `.env` file](#3)
4. [Start the Docker containers](#4)
5. [Authorize SCB to be uploaded on Github](#5)
6. [Create o restore a LND wallet](#6)

You can also [add your BTCPay Server](#7) eventually.

# Before you begin

Clone or download this repository and enter the project directory.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/giovantenne/awning.git
$ cd awning
```

## LND channel backups preparation
The Static Channels Backup (SCB) is a feature of LND that allows for the on-chain recovery of lightning channel balances in the case of a bricked node. Despite its name, it does not allow the recovery of your LN channels but increases the chance that you'll recover all (or most) of your off-chain (local) balances.

**Awning** will automatically upload a copy of your `channel.backup` every time it changes on a Github repository you own, so you will need to create one and provide upload credential [later](#5).

<a name="2"></a>
#### Create a GitHub repository

* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/), sign up for a new user account, or log in with an existing one.

* Create a new repository: [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
  * Choose a repository name (eg. `remote-lnd-backup`)
  * Select "Private" (rather than the default "Public")
  * Click on "Create repository"
  * Annotate your SSH repository address. You will need this [later](#2).

<a name="3"></a>
## Edit and understand the .env file

The `.env` file contains some **Awning** setup parameters that you can/need to customize. Just make a copy of the sample file and edit it.
```sh
$ cp .env.sample .env
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `UID` | The uid (user id) of your current user. Use this command to retrieve it: `id -u`. |
| `GID` | The gid (group id) of your current user. Use this command to retrieve it: `id -g`. |
| `NODE_ALIAS` | The alias your LND node will use |
| `BITCOIN_ARCH` | Here you need to choose your computer CPU architecture. Write `aarch64` for ARM (Raspberry Pi, etc) or `x86_64` for Intel or AMD. |
| `LND_ARCH` | Write `arm64` for ARM (Raspberry Pi, etc) or `amd64` for Intel or AMD. |
| `RTL_PASSWORD` | Choose the password for accessing the *"Ride The Lightning"* web interface. You can change it any time but don't forget to restart the RTL container afterwards with `docker-compose restart rtl`. |
|`LND_PASSWORD` | Choose the password to automatically protected and unlock the LND wallet (write `moneyprintergobrrr` if you are migrating from **Umbrel**). You will need to use this password again [here](#6). Changing this after the first setup will have no effect. |
| `SCB_REPO` | Paste here the address of your new created Github repository. It should be something like `git@github.com:giovantenne/remote-lnd-backup.git`. |
| `BITCOIN_CORE_VERSION` | Bitcoin Core [version](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases) |
| `LND_VERSION` | LND [version](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases) |
| `ELECRTS_VERSION` | Electrs [version](https://github.com/romanz/electrs/releases) |

<a name="4"></a>
# How to begin
The `docker-compose.yml` file contains the **Awning** docker services that your node will run.

Since you are not using the `./awning.sh` utility script, just make a copy of the sample file.
```sh
$ cp docker-compose-sample.yml docker-compose.yml
```


Run the following command:
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```
This will spin-up the following services/containers in background:
- [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)
- [Electrs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)
- [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd)
- [RTL](https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/RTL) (Ride The Lightning)
- [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/)
- [Nginx](https://github.com/nginx) (used as reverse-proxy)
- [SCB](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/recovery.md) (Automatic static channel backups)

The first time it will take some time to build all the images from scratch (especially compiling the Electrs binary can take up to one hour).

After all the images are built, ‚Äúbitcoind‚Äù should start, begin to sync and validate the Bitcoin blockchain. If you already downloaded the blockchain somewhere else, you can just copy the data to the `./data/bitcoin` directory before the `docker-compose up -d --build` command.

Check the status of the bitcoin daemon that was started with the following command. Exit with Ctrl-C

```sh
$ docker logs -f awning_bitcoin
```

Those services open the following TCP ports on your host:

| Port | Service | SSL |  Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `50002` | Electrs | :white_check_mark: | Electrs  |
| `8080` | LND | :white_check_mark: | Rest API for LND  |
| `8081` | RTL | :white_check_mark: | RTL web interface|
| `8082` | RTL | :white_large_square: | RTL web interface  |
| `8083` | BTCPay Server (optional)| :white_check_mark: | BTCPay server web interface|
| `8084` | BTCPay Server (optional)| :white_large_square: | BTCPay server web interface |

# Finish the setup

Once you first start the containers there are still a couple of steps to complete:

<a name="5"></a>
### Authorize SCB to be uploaded on Github

Run this command:

```sh
$ docker logs awning_scb 2> /dev/null | grep -o 'ssh-rsa.*' | head -1
```

* Go back to the GitHub repository webpage
* Click on "Settings", then "Deploy keys", then "Add deploy key"
* Type a title (e.g., "SCB")
* In the "Key" box, copy/paste the string generated above starting (e.g. `ssh-rsa 5678efgh... scb@28ba58e278da`)
* Tick the box "Allow write access" to enable this key to push changes to the repository
* Click "Add key"
<a name="6"></a>
### Create or restore the LND wallet

If you are migrating from **Umbrel** or from an existing LND node just copy your data to the `./data/lnd` directory before the `docker-compose up -d --build` command and skip the rest of this step, otherwise run this command:

```sh
$ docker exec -it awning_lnd lncli create
```

Enter your password as wallet password (it must be exactly the same you stored in `.env` as [LND_PASSWORD](#3)).

To create a a new wallet, select `n` when asked if you have an existing cipher seed. Just press enter if asked about an additional seed passphrase, unless you know what you‚Äôre doing. A new cipher seed consisting of 24 words is created.

These 24 words is all that you need to restore the Bitcoin on-chain wallet. The current state of your channels, however, cannot be recreated from this seed.

üö® This information must be kept secret at all times.

**Write these 24 words down manually on a piece of paper and store it in a safe place.**

# Use Electrs (via TOR)

Run the following command from the **Awning** root directory to retrieve the Electrs TOR address to use in your wallet:
```sh
$ echo `cat ./data/tor/hidden_service_electrs/hostname`:50001
```

# Accessing RTL web interface (local)

Ride The Lightining is accessible on both `http` and `https` with a self signed SSL certificate (so expect a warning message from your browser) using the [password](#3) choosen on the `.env` file.

If you are running **Awning** on your PC you can access the web interface through these URLs:
- [https://localhost:8081](https://localhost:8081)
- [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)

Replace `localhost` with the IP of your node if you are running **Awning** on a different PC.

# Connect Zeus to your node (via TOR)
- Download the Zeus app for your mobile phone.
- Open Zeus and tap on ‚ÄúGET STARTED‚Äù
- Tap on ‚ÄúConnect a node‚Äù and then tap on the ‚Äú+‚Äù at the top right to add your node
- Enter a Nickname for your node (e.g., AwningNode)
- Click on ‚ÄúSCAN LNDCONNECT CONFIG‚Äù and, if prompted, allow Zeus to use the camera
- Scan the QR code generated with the following command. It will be a big QR code, so maximize your terminal window and use CTRL+- to shrink the code further to fit the screen
```sh
$ URI=`cat ./data/tor/hidden_service_lnd_rest/hostname` && docker exec awning_lnd lndconnect --host $URI --port 8080
```

- Click on ‚ÄúSAVE NODE CONFIG‚Äù. Zeus is now connecting to your node, and it might take a while the first time.

| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `configs` | Here you can find all the configuration files. Feel free to edit them as you like, but please be carefull to not mess-up with authentication method: **Awning** currently uses cookies authentication between services instead of RPC. |
| `data` | Here is where the data are persisted. The Bitcoin Blockchain, the Electrs indexes, the LND channels, etc. are all stored here. |
| `dockerfiles` | Here you can find and inspect all the files used to build the images. **Don't trust, verify**! |
| `fragments` | All the services that can be added to the `docker-compose.yml` during the setup tutorial with the `awning.sh` utility script |

# BTCPay Server (optional)

You can easily run your own self-hosted instance of [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org/) with **Awning** with just a few slight modification to a couple of files provided with this repository:

| File | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| `docker-compose.yml` | <ul><li> Replace the `depends_on` directive under the `nginx` section with the one provided.</li><li>Uncomment the `ports` **8083** and **8084** under the `nginx` section. </li> <li>Uncomment the `btcpay`, `nbx` and `postgres` services blocks.</li></ul>|
| `configs/nginx-reverse-proxy.conf` | Uncomment the `upstream` btcpay and **8083**, **8084** `server` blocks. |

Run `docker-compose down` and then `docker-compose up -d` again.

BTCPay server will run 3 additionals containers (requred files and directories are already present on this repository):
- [Postgres](https://github.com/btcpayserver/dockerfile-deps/tree/master/Postgres/13.13)
- [NBXplorer](https://github.com/dgarage/NBXplorer)
- [BTCPay-server](https://btcpayserver.org/)
